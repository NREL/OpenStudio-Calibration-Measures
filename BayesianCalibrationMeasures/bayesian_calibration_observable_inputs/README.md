# Bayesian Calibration Observable Inputs

## Description
This Measure is used to setup the observable inputs Xf: outdoor dry-bulb temperature, the outdoor relative humidity, and the direct solar radiation rate per unit area for a Bayesian Calibration (BC) Analysis.

## Modeler Description
Output Variables for outdoor dry-bulb temperature, the outdoor relative humidity, and the direct solar radiation rate per unit area are inserted into the model at a user defined reporting frequency.  These are later used by the OpenStudio-Server BC algorithms to create the necessary data.xls files for BC.
